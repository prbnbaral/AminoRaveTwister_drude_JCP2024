**Overview of the 2020 polarizable Drude oscillator force field release.
May 2020

NOTE: The lipid or nucleic acid toppar files include the update of the
anionic parameters and merge of the lipid and nucleic acid phosphates.
However, they have not been tested in full lipid or nucleic acid
simulations. Further development of the lipid and nucleic acid
parameters MUST be initiated from these files to maintain consistency
in the overall Drude force field.

General comments
----------------
2020b - Atomtypes from 2020a were merged.
2020a - General updating of 2019 Drude toppar files to include
        recent updates of anionic molecules and other parameters and 
        unification of the atom types and parameters across all the 
        toppar files as described below.
      - Includes changes in parameters without
        merging the atomtypes OD2C2C, OD30BN and PD1AN with
	OD2C2B, OD30B and PD1A respectively.

## master file and proteins

toppar_drude_master_protein_2020b.str
---------------
   * Merged PD1AN with PD1A, OD2C2C with OD2C2B, and OD30BN
     with OD30B. Kept OD30BR for RNA specific bb dihedrals.
   * Updated bonds, angles and dihedrals to comply with merge
   * Updated the NBFIX and NBTHOLE according to merge
   * File format edits by Ase.
   * RESI LSN and PRES NNEU updated according to PAM1 and MAM1,
     respectively. PRES GNNU added specific to GLY neutral N-termial.
   * PRES HS2 updated according to update in HSE.
   * Removed commented parameters (Hui-v9)
   * From lipid, moved parameters for model compounds EAS, MPRO, etc
     to allow using toppar_model without reading toppar_lipid.

toppar_drude_master_protein_2020a.str
---------------
   * From toppar_drude_master_protein_2019g.str
   * Major change was anionic compound nonbonded parameter update
     (Molecular anions paper reference below)
       PD1AN    -- reverted back to PD1A
       OD2C2B   -- re-optimized 
       OD2C2C   -- re-optimized
       OD30BN   -- reverted back to OD30B
       OD30BR   -- reverted back to OD30B  
   * Added atomtype SD1A for sulfur containing model compounds
   * Moved NMA to model toppar file
   * Added bonds, angles and dihedrals related to sulfur
     containing model compounds

toppar_drude_d_aminoacids_2020b.str:
---------------
   * No	changes
     this is based on toppar_drude_d_aminoacids_2019g.str

## model compounds

toppar_drude_model_2020b.str
---------------
   * Moved DMPN to DMP.
   * Merged PD1AN with PD1A, OD2C2C with OD2C2B, and OD30BN
     with OD30B.
   * file format edits by Ase.

toppar_drude_model_2020a.str
---------------
   * From toppar_drude_model_2019g.str
   * Updated parameters and addtional compounds base
     on anionic parameter update (see above) including:
     Updated DMPN topology according to new DMP.
     Updated methylphosphates MP_0, MP_1 and MP_2.
     Added inorganic phosphates HP_1 and HP_2.
     Added SO4, MSO4, MSNA, NMSM, NESM, MEO, ETO.

## carbohydrates

toppar_drude_carbohydrate_2020b.str
---------------
   * No changes from toppar_drude_carbohydrate_2019a.str


** for Nucleic acids and lipids use 2017c versions with master_2019g **

## The nucleic acid and lipid toppar files are not included
## with current 2020 release as the changes below based on recent
## developments have not been validated.  As of May 2020
## additional optimization of the nucleic acid parameters was
## ongoing.

lipid

toppar_drude_lipid_2020b.str
---------------
   * Removed DMPL
   * Dihedral parameters for phosphate group were moved to
     master following the atom type merger.
   * Moved parameters for model compounds EAS, MPRO, MBU etc to
     master to allow using model without reading lipid toppar.

toppar_drude_lipid_2020a.str
---------------
   * From toppar_drude_lipid_2017c.str
   * Updated DMPL and all the lipid topologies for the phosphate
     groups according to the new DMP.
   * Updated dihedral parameters for phosphodiester group
     according to new optimized DMP.
     - CD33C    OD30B    PD1A     OD2C2B 
     - CD33C    OD30B    PD1A     OD30B
    
## nucleic_acids

toppar_drude_nucleic_acid_2020b.str
---------------
   * Merged PD1AN with PD1A, OD2C2C with OD2C2B, and OD30BN
     with OD30B. Kept OD30BR for RNA specific phosphodiester
     backbone dihedrals.
   * Updated bonds, angles and dihedrals to comply with merge
   * Updated the NBFIX and NBTHOLE according to merge
   * File format edits by Ase.

     were updated for atom charges based on new DMP.
   * All nucleobases (including methylated) were updated for
     their alpha and thole parameters according to optimized
     values to reduce the hardwall encounter issue.
   * Updated the optimized backbone dihedrals for NA.
     - epsilon and zeta optimized for BI:BII sampling in DNA.
     - chi optimized for syn and anti.
